## 🛠️ Can I Override Bootstrap Classes?

✅ **Yes, you can absolutely override Bootstrap classes** using your own custom CSS. Here’s how:

### 1. **Use More Specific Selectors**
Bootstrap uses classes like `.btn-primary`. You can override it by using more specific CSS:

```css
/* Bootstrap default */
.btn-primary {
  background-color: #0d6efd;
}

/* Your custom override */
.custom-btn.btn-primary {
  background-color: #ff5722;
}
```

**HTML Usage:**
```html
<button class="btn btn-primary custom-btn">Click Me</button>
```

---

### 2. **Place Your CSS After Bootstrap**
Make sure your CSS file comes **after** Bootstrap in your HTML:

```html
<link href="bootstrap.min.css" rel="stylesheet">
<link href="your-custom.css" rel="stylesheet"> <!-- This should be loaded later -->
```

---

### 3. **Use `!important`** *(only if necessary)*:
```css
.btn-primary {
  background-color: #ff5722 !important;
}
```

---

## 👨‍🏫 Real-World Example:

Suppose Bootstrap’s `.btn-primary` has a blue background, but your brand color is orange:

**HTML:**
```html
<!-- Bootstrap Button -->
<button class="btn btn-primary">Bootstrap Button</button>

<!-- Overridden Button -->
<button class="btn btn-primary custom-orange">Custom Button</button>
```

**CSS:**
```css
.custom-orange {
  background-color: orange;
  border-color: orange;
}
```
