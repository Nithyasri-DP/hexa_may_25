## ðŸ”µ What is a Design Pattern?

A **design pattern** is a **proven solution** to a commonly occurring problem in software design. These are **best practices** adopted by developers to solve recurring design problems.

In C#.NET, design patterns help create **reusable**, **maintainable**, and **scalable** applications.

Design patterns are generally grouped into **three categories**:

| Category | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| **Creational** | Deals with object creation mechanisms |

| **Behavioral** | Deals with object interaction and responsibility delegation |
